Which functions are you going to make polymorphic?
I will make a new printShape() function which will be implemented polymorhpically.

How will you make it polymorphic?
Each class will have its own implementation of what printing means. It will make sense once implemented. 

Can it be a pure virtual function?
No. The base class needs to have its own implementation.

Which class have you made an abstract base class?
Shape
