What will you have to change in your vector class when you add a capacity private member? The capacity is the actual number of elements allocated on the heap for the vector, and the size is the number that is being used.

You'd just have to keep track of the size separate from the capacity. For example, you'd increment both size and capacity when size < capacity and push_back is called (similar for dropping an element), but you'd only change capacity when resize is called or adding a new member would cause size to be greater than the current capacity. 

Write out a plan for the extra constructors you might need for testing this and how the push_back() function changes with regard to having both capacity and size members.

I don't want to bother writing the plan, just look at the implementation.
